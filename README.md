## My project | A simple to do list app

I wanted to build a simple app in order to prioritise my day. The app is inspired by 
[Intelligent Changes's Productivity Planner](https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-productivity-planner). The app enables the user to Add, Edit, Delete and Prioritise Tasks. 

## Technologies 

1. JavaScript (ES6), Node.js, React.js
2. HTML5
3. CSS3 and SCSS
4. Material UI
5. MongoDB, Mongoose

### To run the project

In two different consoles, from the root of the project run the following commands:

```
$ npm run dev:server
$ npm run dev:client
```
